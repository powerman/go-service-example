This project shows an example of how to use go-swagger accordingly to
Uncle Bob's "Clean Architecture".

Also it includes [go-swagger JSON Schema support
cheatsheet](docs/json-schema-cheatsheet.yml), which list all
validations/annotations for JSON body actually implemented by go-swagger
v0.18.0.

# Overview

## The Clean Architecture

[![The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

It's not a complete example of The Clean Architecture itself
(business-logic of this example is too trivial, so "Use Cases" layer in
package `app` embeds "Entities" layer), but it does show the most relevant
part: how to create "API Controller" layer in package `srv/openapi`
between code auto-generated by go-swagger and "Use Cases" layer in package
`app`. Also it includes "DB Gateway" layer in package `dal` (provided
trivial in-memory implementation is "DB" and "Gateway" layers at once).

## The hexagonal architecture, or ports and adapters architecture

It may be even easier to understand implemented architecture as "ports and
adapters":

- "ports" are defined as interfaces in `app/app.go` - they make it
  possible to easily test business-logic in `app` without any external
  dependencies by mocking all these interfaces.
- "adapters" are implemented in `srv/*` (serve project APIs), `dal`
  (access DB) and `svc/*` (use external services) packages - they can't be
  tested that easy, so they should be as thin and straightforward as
  possible and try hard to do nothing than convert ("adapt") data between
  format used by external world and our business-logic (package `app`).

## Structure of Go packages

- `api/*` - definitions of own and 3rd-party APIs/protocols and related
  auto-generated code
- `cmd/*` - main application(s)
- `internal/def` - defaults for both application(s) and tests
- `internal/config` - configuration(s) (default values, env, flags) for
  application(s) subcommands and tests
- `internal/app` - define interfaces ("ports") and implements business-logic
- `internal/srv/*`, `internal/dal`, `internal/svc/*` - implements
  "adapters" (for APIs/UI served by application(s), DB, access to external
  services)
- `pkg/*`, `internal/pkg/*` - helper packages, not related to architecture
  and business-logic (may be later moved to own modules and/or replaced by
  external dependencies)

## Features

- [X] Project structure (mostly) follow [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
- [X] Strict but convenient golangci-lint configuration.
- [X] Easily testable code (thanks to The Clean Architecture).
- [X] Avoids (and resists to) using global objects (to make it possible to
  embed such microservices into modular monolith).
- [X] CLI subcommands support using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
- [X] Graceful shutdown support.
- [X] Configuration defaults can be overwritten by env vars and flags.
- [X] CORS support, so you can play with API using Swagger Editor tool.
- [X] Example go-swagger authentication and authorization.
- [X] Example tests, both unit and integration.
- [X] Production logging using [structlog](https://github.com/powerman/structlog).
- [X] Production metrics using Prometheus.
- [X] Docker and docker-compose support.

# Development

## Requirements

- Go 1.15
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 19.03+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 1.25+
- Tools used to build/test project:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.30.0
go get gotest.tools/gotestsum@v0.5.3
curl -sSfL https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/v0.25.0/swagger_$(uname)_amd64 | install /dev/stdin $(go env GOPATH)/bin/swagger
go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.4.4
go get github.com/cheekybits/genny@master
```

## Setup

1. After cloning the repo copy `env.sh.dist` to `env.sh`.
2. Review `env.sh` and update for your system as needed.
3. It's recommended to add shell alias `alias dc="if test -f env.sh; then
   source env.sh; fi && docker-compose"` and then run `dc` instead of
   `docker-compose` - this way you won't have to run `source env.sh` after
   changing it.

## Usage

To develop this project you'll need only standard tools: `go generate`,
`go test`, `go build`, `docker build`. Provided scripts are for
convenience only.

- Always load `env.sh` *in every terminal* used to run any project-related
  commands (including `go test`): `source env.sh`.
    - When `env.sh.dist` change (e.g. by `git pull`) next run of `source
      env.sh` will fail and remind you to manually update `env.sh` to
      match current `env.sh.dist`.
- `go generate ./...` - do not forget to run after making changes related
  to auto-generated code
- `go test ./...` - test project (excluding integration tests), fast
- `./scripts/test` - thoroughly test project, slow
- `./scripts/build` - build docker image and binaries in `bin/`
    - Then use mentioned above `dc` (or `docker-compose`) to run and
      control the project.
    - Access project at host/port(s) defined in `env.sh`.

### Cheatsheet
```sh
dc up -d --remove-orphans               # (re)start all project's services
dc logs -f -t                           # view logs of all services
dc logs -f SERVICENAME                  # view logs of some service
dc ps                                   # status of all services
dc restart SERVICENAME
dc exec SERVICENAME COMMAND             # run command in given container
dc stop && dc rm -f                     # stop the project
docker volume rm PROJECT_SERVICENAME    # remove some service's data
```

It's recommended to avoid `docker-compose down` - this command will also
remove docker's network for the project, and next `dc up -d` will create a
new network… repeat this many enough times and docker will exhaust
available networks, then you'll have to restart docker service or reboot.

# Run

Use of the `./scripts/build` script is optional (it's main feature is
embedding git version into compiled binary), you can use usual
`go get|install|build` to get the application instead.
